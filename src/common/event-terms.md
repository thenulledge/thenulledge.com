### 1. Who We Are

nullEDGE is operated by **JB Skunkworks LLC** (Minnesota, United States). We organize virtual and in-person ServiceNow conferences for the community. We don't create user accounts—that's handled by RingCentral, our event platform provider. Their [Terms of Service](https://www.ringcentral.com/legal/terms.html) and [Privacy Notice](https://www.ringcentral.com/legal/last-update-august-29-2025/privacy-notice.html) also apply when you use their platform.

For how we handle your data, see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).

### 2. Event Recording & Content

**All events are recorded.** By participating in nullEDGE events, you grant us permission to record, store, and use:

- Your participation in public chat channels and Q&A sessions
- Your voice and likeness (if you enable audio/video)
- Content you share (screen shares, uploaded files)

**We use recordings for:**
- Making sessions available to registered attendees (typically up to 6 months post-event)
- Marketing materials, social media, and testimonials
- Improving future events

**You agree NOT to:**
- Record, reproduce, or redistribute event content without our written permission
- Share your event access credentials with others

**Private messages between attendees are not recorded by nullEDGE.**

### 3. Participant Conduct

We're building a welcoming community. When you attend nullEDGE events, you agree to:

- Be respectful and professional with other attendees, speakers, sponsors, and staff
- Not harass, abuse, or harm others
- Not share illegal, offensive, or confidential information in public channels
- Not spam, solicit, or engage in commercial activities (unless you're a sponsor)
- Follow any additional guidelines provided for specific events

**We reserve the right to:**
- Remove participants who violate these conduct rules
- Ban users from future events
- Report illegal activity to appropriate authorities

Verbal or written abuse of nullEDGE staff will result in immediate removal and ban from future events.

### 4. Speaker Submissions

If you submit a proposal to speak at a nullEDGE event, you provide:

- **Required:** First name, last name, email, professional headline
- **Optional:** Biography, website, LinkedIn profile link
- **If co-presenting:** Co-presenter details (open-ended text field)
- **Session details:** Title, description

Your submission will be reviewed by our team. We may contact you regardless of whether your proposal is accepted.

**By submitting, you agree that:**

- We review all submissions but don't guarantee acceptance
- We may keep your proposal (even if declined) for future event planning
- If accepted, we'll create a speaker profile for you on RingCentral (our event platform)
- If accepted, you grant us permission to feature your name, headline, bio, and session details in event marketing
- You may be contacted about future speaking opportunities
- You retain ownership of your content but grant us a license to record, distribute, and display it in connection with nullEDGE events

### 5. Sponsor Interactions

Most nullEDGE events are free because sponsors support them. Here's how sponsor data works:

**Sponsors receive:**
- Brand visibility (logos, booth presence, speaking opportunities)
- Aggregate event metrics (total attendance, satisfaction ratings, engagement stats)

**Sponsors do NOT receive:**
- Your email, phone, or contact info from event registration

**How sponsors collect leads:**
- If you engage with a sponsor's booth (giveaways, forms, demo requests), you're choosing to share your info with them directly
- This is separate from your event registration with nullEDGE

We're a community conference, not a lead-generation business.
