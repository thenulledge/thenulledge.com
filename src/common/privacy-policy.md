## TL;DR - Privacy in Plain English

**The basics:**
- 🎫 Register for events → We collect your name, email, and role (company/title optional). We **don't share contact lists with sponsors**
- 🎤 Submit a speaker proposal → We keep it (even if we say no) and might contact you for future events
- 💰 Email us about sponsorship → We'll probably email you about future sponsorship opportunities
- 📊 Attend events → We track what you watch, chat messages, polls (via RingCentral)
- 📧 We'll email you about future events (you can unsubscribe anytime)
- 🛍️ Shop purchases → Handled by Fourthwall (separate, their privacy policy applies)

**Sponsor data sharing:**
- ✅ Sponsors get **aggregate metrics only** (total attendance, engagement stats)
- ✅ Sponsors do **not** receive attendee contact lists or individual data
- ✅ If you engage with a sponsor's booth (giveaways, forms, downloads), you choose to share your info with them directly

**Your data rights:**

## Introduction

nullEDGE is operated by **JB Skunkworks LLC** (Minnesota, United States). We organize virtual and in-person ServiceNow conferences for the community.

**Our guiding principle: collect only what we need to run great events.** This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have.

**We will never sell your personal information to anyone. We also won't use your name or company in marketing without your permission.**

---

## What Information We Collect

### Event Registration

When you register for a nullEDGE event, we collect:

- Contact information (name, email)
- Your role and relationship to ServiceNow (to tailor content and understand our audience)
- Company and job title (optional - not everyone has a company, and that's fine)

We collect this through RingCentral's registration system. See the "Technology Partners" section below for details on how RingCentral processes your data.

### Speaker Submissions

When you submit a proposal to speak at our events, we collect:

- **Required:** First name, last name, email, professional headline
- **Optional:** Biography, website, LinkedIn profile link
- **If co-presenting:** Co-presenter details (open-ended text field)
- **Session details:** Title, description

Your submission will be reviewed by our team. We may contact you regardless of whether your proposal is accepted. We keep speaker submissions (including those we decline) to help with future event planning.

If your proposal is accepted, we'll create a speaker profile for you on RingCentral (our event platform) and feature your name, headline, bio (if provided), and session details in event marketing materials and on our website.

### Event Participation

When you attend our virtual events, RingCentral collects on our behalf:

- Which sessions you attended and how long you watched
- Your participation in public chat channels
- Your responses to surveys and polls
- Questions you ask during Q&A sessions
- Technical information (device type, connection quality, browser)

**Important:** We cannot see private or direct messages between attendees. Only public chat messages are visible to us, moderators, and other participants.

### Business Inquiries

When you contact us about sponsorship opportunities or other business matters, we keep that correspondence (including your email address) so we have a history to reference if you reach out in the future. We may also contact you about future sponsorship opportunities.

### Website Usage

When you visit our website, we collect basic information to help us improve the site and ensure security:

- Browser type and operating system
- Pages you visit and how long they take to load
- Which website referred you to us

We use privacy-focused analytics that don't track individual users. No cookies, no persistent identifiers, only aggregate trends.

---

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Process event registrations and send access credentials
- Review and coordinate speaker proposals and sessions
- Manage sponsorship relationships
- Send you information about upcoming events and schedule changes
- Provide customer support
- Improve our events based on attendance and engagement data
- Monitor for technical issues and security threats
- Send you surveys about events you attended
- Provide aggregate metrics to sponsors (see "Sponsor Data Sharing" below)

### Marketing Emails

By registering for our events or submitting a speaker proposal, you agree to receive:

- Emails about upcoming nullEDGE events and sessions
- Surveys and follow-up communications about events you attended
- Announcements about new features, speakers, or sponsors

**If you contact us about sponsorship**, we may email you about future sponsorship opportunities.

**You can unsubscribe at any time** by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email, or by emailing {{ meta.email }} with "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line.

Unsubscribing from marketing emails won't affect your ability to register for and attend future events.

---

## Sponsor Data Sharing

**Most nullEDGE events are free because sponsors support them.** Here's exactly what sponsors get:

### What Sponsors Receive

**Aggregate metrics only:**
- Total event attendance
- Engagement statistics (average session watch time, chat activity)
- Booth visit counts
- Overall satisfaction ratings (e.g., "9.2/10")

**Sponsors do NOT receive:**
- Your email address
- Your name, phone number, or any contact information from your registration
- Individual attendee data of any kind

### How Sponsors Collect Leads

Sponsors may collect contact information directly from you through their virtual booth:

- Giveaway entry forms ("Enter to win X")
- Resource downloads (white papers, free trials, demos)
- Demo booking forms
- Interactive booth content

**When you provide your information through a sponsor's booth, you're choosing to share your contact details with that sponsor.** This is separate from your event registration with nullEDGE.

**Why we do it this way:** We're a community conference, not a lead-generation business. Sponsors support events and earn leads through valuable booth engagement, not by purchasing attendee lists.

## Merchandise Shop

We operate a merchandise shop at [shop.thenulledge.com](https://shop.thenulledge.com) powered by Fourthwall, Inc.

**The shop is separate from our event platform.** When you make purchases or donations:

- Your shop data is governed by [Fourthwall's Privacy Policy](https://fourthwall.com/privacy-policy)
- We don't receive your payment information or shipping address

**Your shop activity is separate from event registrations.** Purchasing merchandise doesn't automatically register you for events, and shop customer data is not shared with event sponsors unless you separately register for an event.

Questions about shop orders? Contact Fourthwall at privacy@fourthwall.com.

## Data Retention

We keep your information only as long as necessary:

- **Registration Information**: 3 years after your last event attendance (to send you info about future events)
- **Speaker Submissions**: Indefinitely unless you request deletion (for future event planning)
- **Event Recordings**: Available to registrants for up to 6 months, then may be archived or deleted
- **Chat Logs & Survey Responses**: Indefinitely (may be used on our website as testimonials)
- **Analytics Data**: 2 years (for reporting and analysis)

- We may be legally required to retain certain records
- Aggregate or anonymized data that can't identify you may be retained indefinitely

---

## Data Security

We take security seriously. Your data is:

- Encrypted when transmitted between our servers and your browser (SSL/TLS)
- Stored on secure servers with access controls

But remember: no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. We can't guarantee absolute security, but we do our best.
