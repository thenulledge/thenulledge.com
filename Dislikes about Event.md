## Dislikes about Event

Frequently taken out of sessions by clicking the wrong spot on the screen.  One schedule link opens an overlay, the other takes you out of your session completely.

A few technical issues for presenters

The platform was good, but could use a few upgrades: Being able to enter a session from the schedule would have been great. Having private messages pop up separate in a pop would help maintain the conversation in the session chat while talking to individuals.

The speakers who were late. Wasting our time. Should be much more organized. Looked unprofessional.

Totally forgivable, but technical glitches.  Several sessions didn't start until halfway through the allotted time.  15 minutes is not a lot of time.   I felt myself wanting the other half of the content from several presenters:  Mail Skodow, James Neale, Adrew Pischulin... short times combined with glitches where people weren't starting on time left us hungry to hear more from these speakers.  But still an awesome, valuable conference.   Best content I've seen assembled since the early days.  Way to go.

sometimes the sessions felt really short. The experience on a mobile device / iphone was quite bad, is used the browser.

Brandon Chung
Some presenter voice was too muffled and not clear. Some Preseneation slide were not on the same subject the presenters were talking about. Presentations visual was small and not clear.

Craig Talbert
Hard to network virtually

I could not see when an event started / ended from the dashboard.
